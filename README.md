在一个陌生的领域探索和学习，能够看到一个「大致」的地图很重要，哪怕它很粗糙，漏洞百出。即便一开始不知道目的地是哪里，如果有一个地图，也会让后续的学习容易的多。

机器人，属于多知识领域交叉，且变化很快，知识体系庞杂，我希望通过整理这样的笔记，对一些关键话题的整理，勾勒机器人知识领域的「大致的」形状。

在本文中，整理了机器人领域的基本概念、大致方法、关键工具。包括机器人运动控制的基本框架、MPC、RL方法过程、ROS、URDF、训练仿真工具。也包括鲁棒性、神经元网络、强化学习、一体化关节、机器学习等常用到的概念术语。

本文编撰求快，求新，求广，求浅，不求甚解，不求精准表述。使用者可以针对自己感兴趣话题进一步探索。

仓促整理，持续迭代，鉴于本人能力和视角，难免内容局限，表述片面，甚至是错误的。期待朋友们的建议和指正，这些反馈对于持续学习持续进步极其重要。

另外，本文信息的绝大部分内容来自于网络，尤其是Kimi，Chatgpt，B站，知乎。


When exploring and learning in an unfamiliar field, having a "rough" map is essential, even if it is incomplete and full of gaps. Even if we don’t know the exact destination at first, a map can make subsequent learning much easier.

Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that evolves rapidly with a complex and expansive knowledge system. Through compiling these notes, I aim to outline a "rough" shape of the robotics knowledge domain by organizing information on some key topics.

This document covers basic concepts, general methods, and essential tools in the field of robotics, including the fundamental framework for robotic motion control, Model Predictive Control (MPC), Reinforcement Learning (RL) processes, ROS, URDF, and tools for training and simulation. It also touches on common terminologies such as robustness, neural networks, reinforcement learning, integrated joints, and machine learning.

The compilation of this document prioritizes speed, novelty, breadth, and a broad overview, rather than in-depth understanding or precise explanations. Users can delve deeper into topics that interest them.

This is a hastily compiled, continuously evolving document. Due to my own limitations in expertise and perspective, it may contain content constraints, partial viewpoints, or even errors. I welcome feedback and suggestions from friends, as these inputs are crucial for ongoing learning and improvement.

Additionally, most of the information in this document is sourced from online platforms, especially Kimi, ChatGPT, Bilibili, and Zhihu.
